  <h2 class='c016'>MEETING OF THE BIOLOGICAL CLUB.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c008'>
    <div>November 4th, 1901.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The Biological Club met in Orton Hall and was called to order
by the president, Prof. Osborn. As it is customary to elect new
officers at the November meeting each year, the Nominating
Committee presented the following names: For president, Mr.
Mills; for vice-president, Mr. Morse; for secretary, Mr. Tyler.
Prof. Lazenby moved that the secretary be instructed to cast the
unanimous ballot of the members present for the names proposed.
Carried. Messrs. J. C. Bridwell, M. T. Cook and Harvey
Brugger were elected members.</p>

<p class='c006'>The retiring president, Prof. Osborn, presented a very interesting
address, an abstract of which follows:</p>

<h3 class='c017'>SCOPE OF MODERN BIOLOGY.</h3>

<p class='c018'>It has been the custom in this society, following a mandate
of its constitution, for the president on retiring from the chair to
give an address, and it is presumed that such an address will
either bring to your attention the results of some special investigation,
summarize the work in some field of research or outline
the progress and problems with which biology has to do.</p>

<p class='c006'>When a year ago you were so kind as to honor me with this
office, two things I think came especially to my mind; one the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>success of the club particularly in the new enterprise of publishing
a journal; the other the duty, honor and privilege of preparing
an address for this occasion. I presume you have all had
the experience of contemplating some distance in the future a
certain duty, debating the most suitable theme or method, and
perhaps seen the time grow shorter and shorter with little real
accomplishment. If I were to enumerate the various topics that
have come to my mind as suitable for this occasion it would
exhaust quite a part of our time; if I could reproduce the
current of thought that has flowed from time to time along the
pathways of such topics, I am sure you would experience a
weariness that I should regret to occasion.</p>

<p class='c006'>The parts of biology which we may make thoroughly our own
are very few. It may be profitable, therefore, occasionally to
take a general survey of the field to see what its sphere of influence
may be, what phases of life are being advanced by its discoveries
or by the distribution of knowledge which follows. It
has seemed to me therefore that it would be appropriate this
evening to attempt some such survey of biology, even though it
be fragmentary and inadequate.</p>

<p class='c006'>For convenience in arrangement we may group this survey
along the lines of practical applications of service to mankind,
such as occur in medicine, agriculture and kindred industries,
domestic and social life, and those which have to do with the
acquisition of knowledge and with education.</p>

<p class='c006'>Applications of biology in medical science, in agriculture and
in domestic life have in many cases assumed such intimate and
essential character that we often look upon them as applied
sciences more than in any other way.</p>

<p class='c006'>While biology has been the foundation of all rational systems
of medicine and the constant servant of this most beneficent of
human professions, the forms of its uses and the wide reach of
its service have so increased in recent years that we almost have
excuse in feeling that it is a modern acquisition.</p>

<p class='c006'>Could the ancient disciples of Esculapius, with their views of
physiology and anatomy, have seen the present scope of these
subjects and the marvelous results in cure and control of diseases
by the discoveries and applications in bacteriology, I doubt if
they would have recognized it as any part of their biology. Still
harder would it have been to appreciate the relations of malarial
parasite, mosquito and man whereby a serious disease in the
latter is occasioned. Intimate relations of two kinds of life, as
evidenced in the common parasites, must have been familiar from
early times and their effects duly recognized, though their means
of access and necessary life cycles were long misunderstood. But
such relations as are found to exist in the production of malaria,
Texas fever and yellow fever have been so recently discovered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>that we count them among the triumphs of our modern science.
Indeed the discovery of such a relationship may be considered as
having been impossible until the methods of modern research and
the basis of knowledge as to life conditions were acquired, and
which made it possible to put the disjointed fragments together.
With the fragments thus related the riddle seems so simple that
we wonder it was not solved before, but we must remember that
it is knowledge which makes knowledge possible.</p>

<p class='c006'>These direct advantages in medical science are however but
part of the great gift to modern methods of disease control, for
the possibilities in the control of disease by sanitation, quarantine,
vaccination, etc., and other methods are all based on
biological data.</p>

<p class='c006'>In speaking of these recent acquisitions I would not disparage
those important, in fact essential subjects of longer growth.
Modern medicine would be a fragile structure without its basis of
comparative anatomy, physiology, materia medica and therapeutics,
which have for long years furnished a basis for rational
methods in surgery and medication.</p>

<p class='c006'>With all this knowledge at hand it is grievous to observe how
general the delusion that disease may be eradicated by some much
emblazoned nostrum, that some vile ‘Indian compound’ will be
thought to have more virtue than the most accurately proportioned
prescription which represents the best that modern science
can do in the adaptation of a particular remedy to a particular
ailment. That the patent medicine business is a most gigantic
fraud and curse will I believe be granted by every scientific man
who has made himself acquainted with the subject. Its immense
profits are attested by the square miles of advertisements that
disgrace the modern newspaper and magazine. Fortunes made
from the fortunes spent in such advertising, along with the commissions
to the lesser dealers, are drawn from a credulous people
who not only receive no value in return, but in most cases doubtless
are actually injured as a result.</p>

<p class='c006'>That no student of biology can be deluded by such preposterous
claims as characterize these compounds, in fact by any
system of cure not based on sound biological principles, seems
only a logical result of his training. I do not recall ever seeing
the name of a biologist among the host of those who sing the
praises of some of these rotten compounds. Mayors, congressmen,
professors, clergymen and other presumably educated parties
appear along with the host of those who fill this guilty list, a list
that should be branded as a roll of dishonor. I believe that
educated men owe some measure of effort toward the abatement
of this plague. Naturally the medical profession is thought to
be the rightful source for action, but among the uninformed any
effort there is attributed to selfish motive. Certainly some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>measure of reform in this direction would be a service to mankind,
and while no sensational crusade may be necessary, each
one who knows enough of the laws of life to appreciate the monstrous
folly of this business has it in his power to discourage it
within the sphere of his individual influence at least. Newspapers
are mostly choked off by the immense revenue derived
from advertising, in fact I have known some which depended
upon this as their main source of support, and have heard the
candid statement that they could not have existed without it. All
the more honor therefore to the few, and there are a few, which
absolutely refuse to allow such advertisements in their columns.</p>

<p class='c006'>That the modern physician must have a thorough knowledge
of biology has become more and more apparent. He has to deal
with life, and life thus far at least cannot be rendered into mere
mechanical, physical or chemical factors. The activities of the
human machine have much that must be studied from the basis
of organic nature. If we do not know all the factors or forces
of life we do know that there is a complex or combination of
forces radically different from any single force of inorganic
nature. Chemical affinity, physical attraction and repulsion,
mechanical forces may furnish many aids, but the study of life
activities must go still further. To do this we must recognize
the laws of organic life, the forces of growth and nutrition, of
reproduction, of evolution, in fact a host of forces which have no
counterpart in the inorganic world.</p>

<p class='c006'>Modern agriculture and horticulture are so dependent on the
principles of biology that to dissociate them does violence to
thought. Indeed this relation has existed through all recorded
history, but in no period has the utility of biologic laws been so
intimately blended with all the processes of cultivation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The determination of the zones of greatest productivity for
different crops, their soil requirements, the introduction and
acclimatization of species belonging to other faunal or floral
regions, the essentials of animal and plant nutrition, the control
of disease or abatement of noxious forms of plant or animal, all
these and more are embraced in the service of biologic science to
agriculture in its various forms and thus to human interests.</p>

<p class='c006'>Among special cases cited, but which cannot be printed here
in detail, were various plant diseases, and particularly various
insect pests, and the discoveries which have brought them more
or less under control.</p>

<p class='c006'>Aside from the sources of food supply, which come under
the general term of agriculture, we derive many articles of diet
from sources dependent on animal or plant life. The various
fishery industries and oyster culture which have been so wonderfully
promoted by biological investigations are excellent examples
of the service of science to mankind. Game laws for the protection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>of certain forms of life of utility to man and the possible
sources of food from various animals or plants not yet utilized
may be mentioned here. Clothing comes in for its share, as in
the methods for protection of silkworms, the saving of fur seals
and other fur-bearing animals from extinction, and the use of
various fibre plants. The successful growth of sponges, of pearls
and many other articles of domestic comfort or ornament are
connected in one way or another with biological problems, and
their fullest development dependent on rational measures possible
when the biological conditions are known.</p>

<p class='c006'>In another way these questions enter into our social and
commercial life. The rights of property in the migrant or semi-migrant
forms of life have biologic as well as legal basis and
some quite peculiar legal decisions would doubtless have been
very different had the biology been appreciated. The classification
of turtles as ‘vermin’ since they are neither fish nor
fowl may be given as a case in point. Equally absurd and sometimes
more disastrous are some of the rulings by customs officers
whose knowledge of biology was doubtless derived from a Greek
lexicon or some equally good authority. Such quarantine restrictions
as have been imposed upon certain products by some
governments show total lack of knowledge as to the possible
conditions of injurious transportation or else the misapplication
of them to serve some special end.</p>

<p class='c006'>The exclusion of American pork and American fruits from
certain countries, the controversy over the fur seals in Alaska,
the inconsistent laws of states or nations regarding game, are
some of the instances where it is evident that the law-making
power and the agents of diplomacy need to be re-enforced with
definite biological knowledge.</p>

<p class='c006'>But there is another phase quite distinct from the purely
utilitarian. Biological science opens up to us the facts of life
and solves some of the questions of the greatest interest to mankind.
What is life? What its origin? What are the factors
that have controlled its development and the wonderful complexities
which we observe in its distribution and adaptations?
Are the forces that operate in the living organism merely physical,
mechanical and chemical or are there activities inherent in life
itself or that operate only in the presence of the life containing
complex? Certainly, in no other branch of science are there
problems more inviting. In no other has present knowledge
given greater inspiration or greater intellectual service to mankind.</p>

<p class='c006'>The field for acquisition of knowledge widens with each new
discovery. We no sooner gain foothold in some hitherto unexplored
realm than we become conscious that beyond this lie still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>other realms, knowledge of which has been dependent on knowledge
of the routes by which they may be reached.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus structure must be known to understand function, and
function known enables us to interpret structure. Evolution
could not be demonstrated until after there had been gathered
the necessary materials to show relations of different organisms,
past and present. But, evolution known, and vast arrays of
structure become intelligible. Without the knowledge of organic
distribution no laws of distribution could be framed, but without
the explanation of distribution afforded by evolution the facts
are an unmeaning puzzle. So, too, without an effort at systematic
arrangement of plant and animal forms no fundamental
law of relationship could have been discovered, but given a law
of relationship and systematic biology assumes a totally different
aspect. Recognition of the multitudinous forms of nature are
but one step then in the presentation of the vast concourse in
their proper relations.</p>

<p class='c006'>No doubt biologists will persist till every form of life has been
adequately described and some means of designating it adopted.
So much may be expected from the enthusiasm of the systematist.
Some centuries of effort must, of course, be expected to
elapse before the task is done. But it is evident that the modern
biology is much less concerned in the mere recognition of these
innumerable forms of life, these remotest expressions of the force
of evolution, than in the gaining of some adequate conception of
their relations, the forces of adaptation that have fitted them for
their particular niche in the realm of nature, their relation to the
other organisms with which they are associated and which constitute
for them a source of support or a menace to existence.
That is, modern biology concerns itself not only with the elements
of structure in the organism, with the means it has of performing
its varied functions with the aggregate of individuals which constitute
its species, but goes on to its relations to all the influences
and forces which have made it what it is and which sustain its
specific existence. Less than this is too narrow a view of the
province of biology. Here is unlimited scope for the student who
pursues knowledge for love of knowledge.</p>

<p class='c006'>As an inspiration to the general student the field of biology has
always held an important place, and in these modern times its
fascination is as potent as ever. Men have attacked the problems
of life from many different viewpoints with greatly different aim
and great difference in preparation and method in their work.
Some of these have sought merely for inspiration for literary
effort, but so far as their records have been exact and truthful
they are contributions to science, when mixed with “vain imaginings”
they become literature and not science, although their
right to rank here may depend on literary merit. Every gradation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>from pure fiction to pure science may be found and every
grade of literary merit as well. White and Goldsmith, Wood
and Figuier, Kipling and Seton-Thompson, with many others
that could be cited, illustrate this wide divergence among writers
who have written to the entertainment and the greater or less
profit of their readers. The value of such works as these is
rather hard to estimate, especially from the scientific standpoint
and particularly when one is under the hallucination of a beautiful
piece of literary creation. They furnish entertainment and
cultivate imagination, some of them stimulate observation and
awaken an interest in nature, but unfortunately many of them
contain so much that is inexact or erroneous that they may sadly
encumber the minds of their readers.</p>

<p class='c006'>But I would like to call attention here to what appears to me a
fundamental condition of scientific work and thereby a necessary
result of scientific training. Science is naught if not exact.
Accurate observation, accurate record, accurate deduction from
data, all of which may be reduced to simple, plain honesty.
Anything else is error, not science. It is not that “honesty is
the best policy,” but that in science honesty is the only possible
policy. Hence, scientific training should give to every student
this one at least of the cardinal virtues, and we may claim with
justice this advantage as one of the results to be derived from
pursuing scientific studies. In fact the relation of science and
biological science, no less than any other, to general schemes of
education, has been one of its most important contributions to
humanity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Biology has influenced modern education both in the matter
taught and the method of its presentation. It has gone farther
and farther into the mysteries of nature and opened up wider
fields of knowledge. It has insisted that the student should be
trained not only in the facts and the accurate interpretation of
facts, but in the methods by which facts may be obtained, thus
providing for the continuous growth of the substance from which
its principles may be verified and definite conclusions reached.</p>

<p class='c006'>In recent years there has been a wide demand for the more
general distribution of knowledge of nature, and “nature study”
has had a prominent place in the discussions of educators. I
must confess to some fear for the outcome of well meant efforts
to crowd such studies into the hands of unprepared teachers,
though surely no one could wish more heartily for a wider extension
of such work well done. It is encouraging to note steady
progress in this line and we should be content not to push ahead
faster than conditions will warrant.</p>

<p class='c006'>Our science is an evergrowing one, and I wish to mention
briefly some of the conditions of biological research and the conditions
essential to its successful prosecution. The time has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>passed when it is possible for the isolated individual to accomplish
much of anything of value in the growth of science. Such
instances as the cobbler naturalist can not well be repeated under
present conditions, and biological workers must expect that some
part at least of their time is spent where libraries, museums and
scientific workers are to be found. I recall meeting some years
ago in an obscure little village, with a young man who was following
a trade, but whose ardent love for nature had brought
him to take up the study of a certain group of insects, and in this
group he had conceived the idea of preparing a work covering the
geographical distribution for the world. With scarcely the
beginning of a library, with no access to general collections,
apparently with no conception of the stupendous nature of the
task he was so ambitiously undertaking, there was perhaps little
danger of his discovering the hopelessness of his case. He doubtless
gained much pleasure and individual profit in the quest, but
for the progress of science, how futile such attempts. Isolated
work is often necessary, often the only way in which certain data
can be secured, but if isolation be permanent, if it means to be
cut off from the records of what has already been done in one’s
line of study, progress is painfully slow and results of little value.
Access then to the world’s storehouses of knowledge, to libraries
and museums where one may determine the conditions of progress
on any given problem is an imperative condition to satisfactory
research.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another condition almost as imperative is time for extended
and consecutive work. There are comparatively few places
where, after passing the stages of preparation, one may have the
opportunity to give uninterrupted time to pure research, but
fortunately such opportunities are increasing.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another factor is necessary equipment, a condition varying
indefinitely with the problem undertaken. Studies of some of
the simpler processes of life may be successfully carried on with
barely any apparatus whatever, while others require the most
costly and complex of machinery. Deep sea investigations, for
example, are possible only with a suitable vessel and elaborate
apparatus for dredging and other operations, and such expeditions
as that of the Challenger, the Blake, the Albatross and
others involve such vast outlays that only the liberality of nations
or of the very wealthy render them possible.</p>

<p class='c006'>However, the modest student without a dollar to invest in
these expensive undertakings may have the opportunity to work
as diligently and effectively as any. So, too, the costly equipments
of marine stations, of universities, of national and state
museums are open to every earnest worker.</p>

<p class='c006'>Still another condition related to the best effort in research is
a satisfactory outlet for publication. Probably no investigator
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>enters on an elaborate extended research without the expectation
that such results as he may obtain, especially such as are novel
and important to the growth of science, shall at some time be
given a public hearing and a permanent record in the annals of
science. However much this ambition may be overworked and
abused, it must be considered the logical and legitimate outcome
of research, valuable as an incentive to work, essential to the
progress of science.</p>

<p class='c006'>The output of scientific laboratories is always pressing hard
upon the organs of publication, and though we have numerous
periodicals open to all, many society proceedings and transactions
devoted to their membership, university bulletins intended primarily
for the staff and students of each institution, still adequate
publication facilities are often wanting. Especially is this true
regarding the suitable illustration of papers which depend largely
on plates or drawings for the elucidation of the text. Our own
modest effort in <span class='sc'>The Naturalist</span> is an attempt to meet one
phase of this demand, but you all appreciate, I think, that it is
insufficient for the needs of our own institution. Some of the
more extended papers resulting from the work of either students
or faculty must suffer oblivion, delay or inadequate presentation.
Evidently a publication fund is one of our pressing needs.</p>

<p class='c006'>Opportunities for research have been much increased within
recent years, and now it is possible for one to look forward with
some assurance to a career in research pure and simple if that is
his desire. As many of those present doubtless anticipate such
career, it may not be amiss to mention some of the opportunities
that now present. Positions in connection with universities and
colleges now as for a long time past offer some of the most available
openings. Fellowships, and positions as assistants with
comparatively light duties with expectation that the holder will
devote himself to investigation that will advance his branch of
science are offered in many places and their value is shown by
the numerous candidates for each position. Many government
positions in Department of Agriculture, Geological Survey and
Fish Commission demand a high degree of training and offer
exceptional opportunities for research.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first few years following graduation are golden days of
opportunity in the way of research. For the majority, perhaps,
these are the days when the greatest amount of original study
may be possible and under conditions favoring the greatest
productivity. As time passes and duties and responsibilities
increase the opportunity for uninterrupted work grows less and
less. Of course original work should follow necessary preparation
but can not be postponed indefinitely, in hopes of a more
favorable season, if the individual hopes to accomplish anything
of value in his chosen science. Too early publication however is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>to be discouraged. Most good things will keep for a time at
least, and the opportunity to test and verify investigations before
publishing is desirable. It is unwise to attempt to harvest a
crop of glory, in scientific fields at least, before the seed has had
time to germinate. The extremes of too hasty publication and
indefinite delay are both to be avoided.</p>

<p class='c006'>But this disjointed address must be brought to a close, I have
indulged in a medley rather than pursuing a connected theme,
but it has been in my mind to show how the influence of modern
biology has been felt in every phase of human life and modified
every phase of human thought. It touches history and illumines
it as a record of human activities, the modifications and adaptations
of the most dominant organism of earth. It touches language
and infuses it with life as the highest evolution of all
means of communication among animals. It enters the sphere
of human relations and we see society, government, law, as the
most complex expression of forces operative all along the line of
organic life.</p>

<p class='c006'>We may gain inspiration in our work from the thought that
our field of labor gives opportunity for the highest service in the
advancement of human interests and the intellectual uplift of the
race.</p>

<p class='c006'>The club extended Prof. Osborn a vote of thanks for his
valuable address.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Ohio State Academy of Science held its eleventh annual
meeting at the Ohio State University in this city on November
29th and 30th. Between thirty and forty papers were given and
the attendance was considerably above the average. On the
evening of the 29th a joint meeting was held with the Modern
Language Association of Ohio, which held its annual session at
the University on the dates mentioned above. The committee
arranged an interesting and appropriate program for the evening
and a large and appreciative audience responded. The Academy
meetings have been held heretofore during the Christmas vacation,
therefore holding it at this time was an experiment, but
judging from the program, attendance, and enthusiasm manifested,
the meeting this year may be said to be one of the best

<p class='c006'>It is of more than ordinary interest to be able to record the
taking of specimens of the European ruff, Pavoncella pugnax
(Linn.) in Ohio. Two male specimens are in the Dr. Jasper

<p class='c005'>The plants listed below have been found growing in the State
without cultivation. A large number of them are adventive
species but not hitherto recorded in the Ohio list. Three of the
names occurred in the old lists and were noted in the Catalogue
of 1893 by Kellerman and Werner, but were discarded in the
Fourth State Catalogue, published in 1899. These here referred
to and which are below restored to the Ohio list, are Nos. 683<i>a</i>,
1423<i>b</i>, and 1990½<i>a</i>. No. 893<i>a</i> was included in L. D. Stair’s
list of Railway Weeds. All the others are wholly new to the
listed flora. While several persons have contributed to this
increase, special thanks are due to Mr. Otto Hacker, who formerly
as well as at present, contributed largely to a fuller knowledge of
the State flora. Mr. Hacker has furnished specimens of all the
species credited to him below and these are deposited in the State
Herbarium. The rich field for adventive species in the region
of Painesville may be understood when it is stated that the
extensive and long-established nursery grounds of Storrs and
Harrison are located at this place.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'><i>Item 1.</i> It has been asked how many species of plants occur
in Ohio. Only a guess can at present be made. In the Catalogue
of Ohio Plants, by Kellerman and Werner, prepared in
1893, there were listed 1,925 Spermatophytes, 68 Pteridophytes,
335 Bryophytes, and 1,400 Thallephytes. The Fourth Catalogue,
by the writer, published in 1899, gave 2,025 species of
Pteridophytes and Spermatophytes. While many additions to
the previous list were included, very many species formerly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>reported were excluded because unauthenticated by herbarium
specimens, and others were undoubtedly extra-limital for Ohio.
Two Annual Supplements to this catalogue have been issued,
bringing the number of species of the vascular plants, nearly all
authenticated, up to about 2,150. The mosses, the higher fungi
and the lichens have been listed with some degree of fullness,
but most of the other lower plants have been very incompletely
placed on record, though large collections, only partially worked
up as yet, are now in the herbarium of the State University.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Item 2.</i> Miss Ruth E. Brockett, of Rio Grande, Gallia
County, Ohio, has found the Showy Skullcap, Scutellaria serrata
Andr., previously unreported for this State. The distribution,
as given in Britton’s Flora, is New York and Pennsylvania to
North Carolina, Illinois and Kentucky. In the Rio Grande
region many interesting or new plants for the Ohio list have
hitherto been detected by Miss Brockett, as the Fringe Tree
(Chionanthus virginica), the Purplish Buckeye (Aesculus
octandra hybrida), and others too numerous to mention.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Item 3.</i> An interesting and suggestive study has been published
by Herman Dingler (Muenchen) on the organs for wind-dispersal
(flug-organe) in the Vegetable Kingdom. The title of
the book is “Ein Beitrag zur Physiologie der passiven Bewegungen
im Pflanzenreich.” After describing fully the mechanics
involved, and the methods of investigation, the author enumerates
the <i>Chief Types</i> of the flight organs as follows (prefixing to
the word “flyer” the descriptive words, 1, dust; 2, granule;
3, bubble; 4, hair; 5, pan; 6, umbrella; 7, sail; 8, disk-twist;
9, barrel-twist; 10, plain-twist; 11, screw, and 12, screw-twist):</p>

<p class='c022'>A critical inspection of the nomenclature used for the first
Fascicle of the Ohio Fungi might seem to warrant the conclusion
that the judgment of more recent workers is sometimes ignored
and that a too conservative course has been adopted. But it
should be remembered that the main purpose is to furnish Ohio
material accompanied by names (occasionally synonyms) that
were undoubtedly applied to the species represented. I have
preferred to use for the Rust on Sunflower, Puccinia helianthi,
rather than P. tanaceti—recent work on other species suggesting
that with this also when fully studied, a physiological distinction
may supplement the too insignificant morphological difference.
Again, I have used Aecidium album, which Clinton applied to
the first stage of the Uredine found on Vicia, not ignorant of the
fact that Dietel gives this as a stage of Uromyces albus—but
should not this first be substantiated by cultures? It is to be
added that through inadvertency Peck’s later name (Aecidium
porosum) was used, hence here follows a corrected label with
both Clinton’s and Peck’s descriptions:</p>

  <h2 class='c016'>NOTES OF TRAVEL IN PORTO RICO.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c008'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Robert F. Griggs.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>By its configuration, Porto Rico is divided into two parts very
distinct from each other in almost every respect and of primary
importance in all the affairs of the island. The north side, which
comprises about two-thirds of the total area, is kept constantly
wet with almost daily rains. On the south it has been known
not to rain for a whole year in some places. On the north side
grows an abundance of luxuriant, tropical vegetation; on the
south in many localities are barren hills covered only with scrub
brush. But throughout the island there is great local variation
in all the climatic and physical conditions.</p>

<p class='c006'>Along most of the north side there stretches a low, coast plain,
out of which rise numberless, small, steep hills. This plain,
everywhere well watered, is in most places very fertile, but in
the vicinity of Vega Baja it becomes a sandy waste. This sand
desert is one of the most peculiar places it has ever been my
fortune to visit. There is no grass (turf-making grass is almost
unknown in the tropics), neither are there large trees. Everywhere
are low bushes not much more than ten feet tall. The
sand beneath them is bare in many places, but is covered in others
with various forms of herbage, most of which, instead of being
composed of desert forms, as would be expected, is made up of
the most typical water-loving plants, among which, Sphagnum
(two species) and Utricularia are noteworthy. Imagine, if you
can, a sphagnum bog shading into loose sand in a distance of
only ten feet with no change in level. The explanation of this
peculiar fact is, however, not hard to find. The rainfall is so
copious that wherever there is any means of holding it, the
hydrophytes take hold and spread, themselves acting as water
holders when once started, while in other places the water quickly
soaks into the sand and leaves it as dry as ever.</p>

<p class='c006'>The plain on which this sand desert is located is separated in
most places from the sea by low hills. It is very level and was
probably once covered with water out of which projected many
rocky islands—the limestone hills of to-day. These hills are a
very characteristic feature of the country. From an incoming
vessel they are plainly seen projecting like saw teeth all along the
coast; from an eminence back in the country they appear to
have no system or regularity whatever, but stick up anywhere
sharp and rugged as though shaken out of a dice box onto a
board. Further inland they are closer together with no plain
between, though in other respects like those of the coast.
It is as though they were eroded when the sea stood lower than
it does to-day, perhaps very much lower; then the valleys were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>filled up during a period when the sea was slightly higher than
at present, whence it has receded and left the island of to-day.
They are covered with a characteristic jungle, rising conspicuously
out of which is the “Llume” palm (<i>Acria attenuata</i>) whose
graceful stem, only about half a foot thick at the base, attains a
height of a hundred feet, tapering till it is only three or four
inches thick at the top. It is nearly white and at a distance
entirely invisible, so that the crown of leaves looks as though it
were floating around in the air above the surrounding vegetation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Further inland the limestone hills give way to others of red
clay. The clay, like the limestone, is very deeply eroded. In
most places it is so continually washed down that the sides of the
hills stand always at the critical angle and are ready to slide from
under the feet of the explorer. Indeed it would be impossible to
climb them were it not for the numerous bushes everywhere
standing ready to lay hold on. Here abound ferns, Melastomaceae
and other plants of humid regions. Tree ferns are very
common; the largest belong to one species of Cyathia. Its
beauty is simply beyond description. Imagine, you who have
never seen it, a trunk thirty feet tall surmounted by a crown of a
dozen or fifteen great leaves made up of a score or two pinnae of
the size and grace of ordinary ferns and you have the components—not
the ensemble—of the tree fern.</p>

<p class='c006'>This red clay region is the land of coffee. Everywhere the
novice thinks the hillside covered with jungle, which turns out
to be only poorly kept coffee plantations. The coffee region is
coextensive with the range of several plants. Two or three
species of the pepper family, with large peltate or round leaves,
are found only here; and with one or two exceptions the Melastomaceae
occur only in this wet country. They are a very large
group of plants common throughout the tropics, but represented
in the northern states by the common Rhexia. Its members may
be known anywhere by their three-nerved leaves, many of which
are beautifully patterned and marked so that even among other
tropical plants they are conspicuous for their beauty.</p>

<p class='c006'>When we cross the summit we come upon a different sort of
vegetation; cacti take the place of tree ferns, and instead of wet
jungles we have dry scrub brush full of spiny and thorny shrubs
with almost every sort of prickle one can think of. One who has
never encountered them can scarcely appreciate the abundance
and effectiveness of tropical thorns. These thickets of brush
extend over most of the undisturbed portion of the south side.
Everywhere through them there are scattered cacti of several
sorts; but near Guayanilla, a few miles west of Ponce, these
become relatively much more numerous so as to form a veritable
cactus desert. Only here is the largest form present. It is a
large Opuntia with a bare stem and long arms radiating in one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>or two whorls near the top. Besides it there are several species
of Cereus and another small Opuntia similar to the common prickly
pear, together with a species of the same group cultivated for its
fleshy branches which are eaten. All through this dry region
agaves or century plants are very common. There seem to be
several species, but they are such terrors to botanists that it is
hard to tell anything about them.</p>

<p class='c006'>From this brief sketch it will be seen what a diversified flora
Porto Rico offers to the student. There are opportunities for
several ecological studies of surpassing interest, and on the systematic
side the work has only been begun. At present there are
scant facilities for the student, but with the fuller occupation of
the island by American government and customs, we may hope
that some of our enterprising universities will establish there a
school of tropical agriculture and botany, fields now white for the
harvest but almost without workers.</p>

  <h2 class='c016'>SALAMANDERS TAKEN AT SUGAR GROVE.</h2>

</div>

<p class='c005'>On May 25, 1901, Prof. Hine, while collecting in the hills at
Sugar Grove, Fairfield County, O., found a salamander under a
piece of pine log on the slope of a hill, about a hundred yards
from water. It was, for the time, put in a jar along with several
individuals of Desmognathus fusca Raf., which were taken in, or
within a few feet of the rivulets which flow down the valley.
Aside from this specimen taken on the hillside, all the specimens
were found not farther than a half dozen feet from the water.
When the collections were examined in the laboratory it was
found that the single specimen just mentioned differed in many
respects from the others. This led to investigation and it was
found that it corresponded closely with the description of D.
ochrophæa Cope. Thus, the posterior portion of the mandible was
edentulous; no tubercle in canthus ocelli; belly paler than in
any of D. fusca taken; length nearly three-fourths of an inch
shorter than the others; a light bar from eye to corner of mouth;
tongue free behind; parasphenoid teeth separated behind. The
specimen was kindly examined by Dr. J. Lindahl, of the Cincinnati
Society of Nat. Hist., who is acquainted with the form. He
agreed that it corresponded with the description of Cope.
Whether the characters as given above are sufficient to place the
specimen under ochrophæa is a matter hard to decide. Cope
gives the range of ochrophæa as “in the Alleghenies and their
outlying spurs.” Dr. Lindahl has a specimen from Logansport,
Ind., taken November 10, 1900.</p>

<p class='c006'>About three-fifths of Columbiana County is drained by Beaver
Creek, one-fifth by the Mahoning River and streams leaving the
county to the west, while the remainder enters the Big Yellow
and Little Yellow Creeks. Beaver Creek is practically confined
to Columbiana County, though it empties into the Ohio River in
Pennsylvania at Smith’s Ferry, just above the state line. The
relation of Beaver Creek to the Mahoning River is interesting,
the two being in general, arcs of concentric circles with the
Mahoning outside. A person going directly west from Salem
crosses Middle Fork of Beaver Creek first, then the Mahoning,
and the same is true if he goes directly north or directly east.
South-west of Salem the small streams empting into the Mahoning
have not been seined. From one of these Herman McCane has
taken a specimen of Ichthyomyzon concolor which is preserved in
the Salem High School collection with the other species here
recorded. All the other streams in close proximity to Salem are
part of the system of the Middle Fork of Beaver Creek, with the
exception of Cold Run, which flows almost directly south into
the West Fork of Beaver Creek, the stream thus formed soon
being augmented by the waters of the North Fork.</p>

<p class='c006'>Seining has been done only near Salem in small tributaries and
where Middle Fork has an average width of not more than ten or
twelve feet. Mr. Albert Hayes, Mr. J. S. Johnson and Mr.
F. W. Webster have helped me draw the seine. Mr. Webster
has also given me many valuable suggestions as to suitable
localities.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Mr. A. J. Pieters</span>, Assistant Botanist in the U. S. Dept. of
Agriculture, has written an interesting and useful article<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c023'><sup>[1]</sup></a> on the
plants of western Lake Erie. This report should be read by all
who are interested in the hydrophytes of Ohio, or in the flora
and fauna of Lake Erie. In addition to some introductory
remarks, the paper treats of the plants in Put-in-Bay, in Squaw
Harbor, near Gibraltar Island, in Hatchery Bay and in the open
lake, and the plants of East Harbor. The swamp vegetation is
also discussed, including the plants in the Portage River swamps
and in the swamps about Sandusky Bay. The ecological conditions
and the ecological adaptations of the flora are treated quite
fully, and at the end are given alphabetical lists of the plants
studied, including angiosperms, stoneworts and desmids.</p>

  <h2 class='c016'>COLLECTING TABANIDÆ.</h2>
</div>

    <div><span class='sc'>James S. Hine.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The habits of flies belonging to the family Tabanidæ, commonly
called horse-flies or gad-flies, furnish much material for
study and observation. I take this opportunity to record some
of the notes which I have taken in the last few years while
endeavoring to collect and study the local species of the family.
Although the eggs, larvæ and pupæ of many species have been
studied, what I have to say in this paper pertains wholly to the
adults. Members of the family are usually taken by every entomologist
who does general collecting, but as a usual thing males
are seldom taken; in fact this sex is so poorly represented in
collections that no key has been published for identifying the
males of our American species. The student must use the key
to the females as far as possible and guess at the rest. In very
many cases the male is not even described, so that sometimes,
when the sexes are unlike, they can be associated only by observations
in the field. By careful collecting and observation we
have procured practically all of our local species in both sexes,
and the derived benefit, satisfaction and enjoyment have paid us
fully for our time and pains.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the first place the mouthparts of the two sexes are different—the
male lacks the mandibles which are present in the
female. This makes it necessary for them to procure their food
from different sources, the male obtains his from flowers, while
the female lives by puncturing the skin and sucking the blood of
warm-blooded vertebrates. Thus it is evident that during the
time spent in procuring food the sexes cannot remain together.
From an economic standpoint the female most concerns the
student and she is often taken for study without an attempt being
made to procure the male.</p>

<p class='c006'>At this point I can say collect females around horses, cattle and
other animals, and males on flowers; but this is not enough, for
knowing the general habits of insects we are certain that there is
a common ground where the two sexes may be found together.
One finds this common ground in the vicinity of water, where
their transformations take place and where their eggs are laid,
also in various other places, which we shall take occasion to discuss
as we proceed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The females of all our local species of Chrysops with Tabanus
pumilus and nivosus come buzzing around the collector in numbers,
and at such times may be taken easily with a net. Other
species of Tabanus come near enough that the sound of their
wings is recognizable, but are so active that it is almost impossible
to procure them.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>During the time the female is ovipositing the male is often
sitting near by on the foliage. At Georgesville, Ohio, June 4th,
I observed C. mœchus ovipositing on foliage overhanging a mill-race;
soon after specimens of the male sex were observed resting
on the upper leaves of the same plant on which females were
ovipositing. In a few minutes collecting, a dozen or more specimens
of each of the sexes were procured. The only males of C.
indus I have ever taken were procured at Columbus, on the
border of a small pond, where the females were ovipositing.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sexes of many species of Tabanus often alight on the bare
ground of paths or roads that run through or along woods. At
Cincinnati, June 10th, in company with Mr. Dury, we procured
large numbers of the sexes of different species resting on some
furrows that were plowed around a woods to prevent the spread
of fire. We also took the same species resting in paths and roads
that ran through the woods. Some of these same species were
also taken from low-growing foliage in sunny places among the
trees. At Medina, Ohio, males and females of T. vivax and
trimaculatus were taken while resting in a road that ran through
a dense woods.</p>

<p class='c006'>One of the best places I have ever found to get the sexes of
Chrysops and Tabanus is in the tall grass that skirts the marshes
of Sandusky Bay. This grass is the Phragmites of botanists and
grows to a great height by July 1st. On July 6th, at Black
Channel, when the wind was high I went into a patch of this
grass that was so dense that I could not use a net to advantage.
Here I saw an abundance of flies and found that by approaching
them very slowly I could readily pick the specimens off with my
fingers. The male and female of T. stygius, nivosus, C. æstuans
and flavidus and the male of T. affinis and bicolor were taken in
this way. I found that this same species of grass afforded excellent
collecting wherever found, but most material was procured
when the wind was high. On the same date and near the same
place the male of C. flavidus was taken from the flowers of the
common spatter-dock, and this and æstuans were procured by
sweeping in the adjacent low-growing herbage. R. C. Osburn
informs me that he has had excellent success in collecting Tabanids
from tall grass near water in his experience.</p>

<p class='c006'>Tabanus sulcifrons Macq. is an abundant species in northern
Ohio during the latter part of July and all of August. So common
that by actual count twenty-eight specimens were taken
from a cow in ten minutes, while a few that alighted on the animal
during that time were not procured. August 1st of the
present year I was at Hinckley, Medina County, and spent the
day taking observations on this species. In the morning about
nine o’clock I went to the border of a woods where I had often
observed the species before. Here males and females were found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>in abundance crawling over the trunks and foliage of trees, on the
fence along the woods and flying about generally. One pair was
observed in copulation on the fence, and I am of the opinion that
the presence of so many flies in the locality at the time is explained
on the ground that it was the general mating place of the
sexes. On several occasions I have made observations which lead
me to believe that the sexes of various species of the family
copulate among foliage often high up in the trees. As Tabanids
are not easily procured with a net from the surface of a rough
rail, I tried the experiment of picking the specimens off with my
fingers and found that it was surprisingly successful, if the movement
toward them was made very slowly until just ready to touch
them when the fingers were gripped quickly. Near a watering
trough where a herd of cattle drank daily I found males in numbers
resting on the ground where the turf had been tramped off.
Along Rocky River I observed both sexes fly down to the water
and dip several times in succession and then away to alight on a
stone on the bank or disappear from sight altogether.</p>

<p class='c006'>On July 29th I rode from Sandusky to Cleveland by boat.
Although we were from two to five miles off shore all the time,
males and females of T. sulcifrons often came on board and
alighted on the canvas and rigging of the boat. From this it is
evident that this species at least may fly for some distance over
water.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have taken Goniops chrysocoma on several occasions. It
has a habit which is of value to the collector. At Hinckley,
Medina County, I took several females and observed that they
have the habit of stationing themselves on the upper side of a
leaf, where by vibrating their wings rapidly and striking the
upper surface of the leaf at each downward stroke, make a rattling
noise which can be heard plainly several feet away. At
Vinton last spring Mr. Morse and myself identified the characteristic
sound of the species and were guided by it to procure
specimens.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have taken the male of Pangonia rasa on blossoms of sumac
at Medina, Ohio, in August.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Agromyza setosa</span> Loew—The larvæ of several species of the
genus Agromyza are known to mine the leaves and stems of
various plants. Cabbage, potatoes, corn, clover, strawberries, verbenas,
chrysanthemums and sunflowers are among the cultivated
plants from which various species of the genus have been reared;
while plantain, round-leaved mallow, golden-rod, aster, cocklebur,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>rag-weed and wild-rice are given as their food-plants. In
some cases a single species of fly has been reared from a half
dozen or more different plants. Agromyza setosa Loew, as determined
by Coquillett, was reared in numbers from leaves of wild-rice,
Zizania aquatica, at Sandusky during August of each of the
years 1900 and 1901. Professor Osborn studied the species and
its work in 1900, while my observations were made a year later.
Although I include the notes taken by both of us, many points
are needed before a detailed account of the habits and life history
of the species can be given.</p>

<p class='c006'>The eggs are conspicuous on account of their abundance and
white color, and are deposited chiefly on the upper surface of the
leaves of the food plant.</p>

<p class='c006'>The larvæ upon hatching bore into the leaf and feed beneath
its upper covering. When full grown they measure about 6 mm.
in length, are white, or greenish on account of chlorophyl taken
in with their food, and are furnished with strongly chitinous
mouth parts. The mines which they make in the leaves are
irregular in width and extend for varying lengths on one side or
the other of the mid-rib. These variations in extent are usually
explainable from the fact that a variable number of larvæ occupy
the different mines. The work of the larvæ is apparent from
the first on the upper side of the leaf, and may be seen beneath
after a few days because of the fact that the parts beneath the
mine sooner or later turn yellow.</p>

<p class='c006'>The pupa is to be found either in the mine or clinging to the
surface of the leaf. It is brown in color, with two prominences
anteriorly where the attachment with the leaf is effected, and is
contained within the last larval skin so that the legs and wing-pads
are at no time visible from the outside.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Bibio albipennis</span> Say—Larvæ observed in colonies under
fallen logs, and boards which were lying on the ground. Specimens
taken April 4th pupated May 5th and the adults appeared
May 13th. The adults were unable to fly for several hours after
they emerged on account of their wings remaining soft. I observed
the first males flying out of doors on the 23d of May.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chrysopila ornata</span> Say—Larva about an inch and a half
in length, white in color, cylindrical, with an enlargement at the
posterior end bearing a number of fleshy elongations which are
about the length of their basal breadth. Found under rotten
wood May 1st. Pupa brown, last segment armed with six
spinose teeth, the two on the ventral side arising from the same
base, the remaining abdominal segments furnished with a circlet
of spines near the posterior third. The adult emerged the 18th
of June.</p>
